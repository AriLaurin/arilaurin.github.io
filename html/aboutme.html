          <h1 id="sptitleABOUTME">ABOUT ME</h1>

          <p id="spparagraphABOUTME">My name is Arijus Laurin and I'm born in 1st of March 2005. I am a male originally from Lithuania<br>
            but moved to Norway when I was around one year old. I live in Norway to this day and Norwegian was the first language<br>
            I actually learned. Since my childhood I was always into computers as it was a easy way for me to distract myself. <br>
            Which lead to me being really interested and dedicated to learning Computer Science now. A majority of my day is spent by <br>
            the computer, and I either play games or delve further into the computer programming world. In my "WORK EXPERIENCE" page <br>
            you can read more about what I do by the computer in my free time. Despite being a person who spends a majority of their time <br> 
            by the PC, I am still a really social and active person. I really love spending time with my friends and I cherish every moment I get <br>
            to spend with them. I also keep myself active by going to the gym, boxing or attending other <br>
            outside exercises. If there is something I'd want to say to people who are interested to get to know me, I would just want to say; <br>
            That I am an open minded person and I stay loyal to the people who are important to me, I<br>
            am someone to takes inatiative and can always step up as a leader when one is needed.  </p>
